# Threat Hunt Report: Malicious Firefox Extension Installation

**Malicious Firefox Extension Installation and Data Exfiltration Simulation**

---

## Scenario

A recent increase in alerts related to **unusual browser extension installations** or **suspicious outbound connections from web browsers** has been observed by the Security Operations Center (SOC). This could indicate a user inadvertently installing a **malicious Firefox extension**, leading to potential data exfiltration or further compromise.
This hunt aims to identify any such unauthorized or malicious Firefox extension activity within the environment.

---

## High-Level IoC Discovery Plan: Malicious Firefox Extension

1. **DeviceFileEvents**

   * Look for `.xpi` file downloads or creations from unusual sources.
   * Investigate unexpected files (e.g., `firefox_history_dump.txt`) in Firefox profile directories.

2. **DeviceProcessEvents**

   * Identify abnormal `firefox.exe` behavior, such as spawning `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`.
   * Look for process command lines referencing `.xpi` files.

3. **DeviceNetworkEvents**

   * Monitor unauthorized outbound connections from `firefox.exe`.
   * Flag connections to suspicious domains (e.g., `exfil-data-c2.com`) or unusual external IPs.

4. **DeviceRegistryEvents**

   * Look for registry modifications that enable persistence mechanisms.

5. **Correlation of Events**

   * Combine multiple indicators for higher confidence (e.g., file creation + process spawn + suspicious outbound connection).

6. **Threat Intelligence**

   * Cross-reference file hashes, domains, and IPs with threat intelligence feeds.

## Steps Taken (Simulation in Azure VM)

**Purpose:** Simulate a user tricked into installing a malicious Firefox extension to generate logs and IoCs.

### 1. Download Simulated Malicious Extension

```plaintext
- Download a benign .zip file.
- Rename it to: malicious_firefox_ext.xpi
- Save to: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Desktop\
```

### 2. Attempt to Install Extension in Firefox

```plaintext
- Drag and drop malicious_firefox_ext.xpi into Firefox.
- Click "Add" (or allow the warning to generate logs).
```

### 3. Simulate Data Exfiltration Network Activity

```plaintext
- In Firefox, visit: http://exfil-data-c2.com/data (nonexistent domain to generate DNS lookup).
```

### 4. Simulate Local Data Access

```plaintext
- Create a file: firefox_history_dump.txt
- Location: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Desktop\
```

### 5. Clean Up

```plaintext
- Delete malicious_firefox_ext.xpi
- Delete firefox_history_dump.txt
```

## Summary

This threat hunt successfully simulated a **malicious Firefox extension installation** and its typical behaviors, including file creation, extension installation attempts, and simulated C2 communication.

---

## Response Taken

### **1. Incident Validation & Assessment**

* Verified IoCs (`malicious_firefox_ext.xpi`, `firefox_history_dump.txt`, suspicious outbound IPs).
* Expanded queries across endpoints to scope the incident.

### **2. Containment**

* Isolated `cwav3-stig` via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
* Blocked `192.0.2.1` and `exfil-data-c2.com` on firewalls and DNS.

### **3. Eradication**

* Removed suspicious files and reset Firefox profile.
* Scanned endpoint for additional malware.

### **4. Recovery & Hardening**

* Applied patches, updated Firefox, and enforced stricter extension policies.

### **5. Post-Incident**

* Enhanced detection rules in MDE.
* Conducted forensic analysis and user awareness training.
